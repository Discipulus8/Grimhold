                        among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the<br>
                        reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria, and was named<br>
                        after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. As the<br>
                        second son of King George V, he was not expected to inherit<br>
                        the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder<br>
                        brother, Edward. He attended naval college as a teenager, and<br>
                        served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First<br>
                        World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady<br>
                        Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters Eliza-<br>
                        beth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he had speech therapy for<br>
                        a stammer, which he never fully overcame.<br></p>

                    <p class="tab">George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII<br>
                        upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year<br>
                        Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite<br>
                        Wallis Simpson. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised<br>
                        Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not<br>
                        marry a divorced woman and remain king. Edward abdicated <br>
                        to marry Simpson and George ascended the throne as the third<br>
                        monarch of the House of Windsor.
