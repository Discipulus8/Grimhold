                    <p>Known publicly as Albert until his accession, and "Bertie"<br>
                    among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the<br>
                    reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria, and was named<br>
                    after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. As the<br>
                    second son of King George V, he was not expected to inherit the<br>
                    throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder<br>
                    brother, Edward. He attended naval college as a teenager, and<br>
                    served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First<br>
                    World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady<br>
                    Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters<br>
                    Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he had speech therapy<br>
                    for a stammer, which he never fully overcame.<br></p>

                    <p>George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon<br>
                    the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year<br>
                    Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite<br>
                    Wallis Simpson. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised<br>
                    Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry<br>
                    a divorced woman and remain king. Edward abdicated to marry Simpson<br>
                    and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of<br>
                    Windsor.
